Currency:  The renminbi (RMB, sign: ¥; code: CNY; also CN¥, 元 and CN元) is the official currency of the People’s Republic of China.
The yuan (元/圆) (sign: ¥) is the basic unit of the renminbi, but is also used as a synonym of the currency, especially in international
contexts – the ISO 4217 standard code for renminbi is CNY, an acronym of “Chinese yuan” (a similar case is the use of the terms sterling
and pound to designate the British currency and unit).  Its name (simplified Chinese: 人民币; traditional Chinese: 人民幣; pinyin: rénmínbì)
literally means "people's currency".
